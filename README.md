Building the stock market prediction Engine
One of the Financial Analytics company wants to build a statistical algorithm for algorithmic trading and they hired you as the data scientist to help them.
Data Description
The data contains anonymized features relating to a single financial asset. The data contains 111 columns where the targets are y1 and y2.
First column is the timestamp which indicates the day at which the event occurred
“y1” (Numeric) is the percentage change (http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/03/100303.asp ) in asset price of w.r.t. the previous day’s asset price.
“y2” (Binary) is the volatility (http://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) of the asset w.r.t. previous 2 weeks – 0 implies the asset is not volatile and 1 means it is.
You are expected to build at one classification model on “y2” and one regression model on “y1” using either of regression or time-series techniques.
